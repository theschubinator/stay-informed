				<ul>
				  <li>"As a teacher it is very frustrating not knowing important dates. Unil our school started using 'In the Loop' I never knew what was going on. Now I know exactly what my principal expects from me and when."</li><br>
				  <li>"My employees never seemed to know what expected of them and when. Sending email communications only went so far. I still had to rely on the employees to remember the information being communicated to them. Now, In the Loop organizes it all for them. In the Loop has allowed us to take our buisiness to the next level! Thank You In the Loop!!!"
