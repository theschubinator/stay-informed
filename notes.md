Issues::

1) Validations with AJAX requests...



Questions:
1) How does AJAX request know about the user_id automatically?
2) Is there a way to link different JS files so you could use a function in task.js that is located in categories.js for example?
3) Is there a way to write a <script> in the HTML that renders the HTML of the JS Code instead of hard coding it as a string within the actual JS code?
